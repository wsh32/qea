Consider a body moving in 3D with position vector

\begin{align*}
    \boldsymbol{r}(t) = a\cos(ct) \hat{\boldsymbol{i}} + b \sin(ct) \hat{\boldsymbol{j}}
\end{align*}

Describe the path that the body should take.

\begin{solution}
    The body is moving in an ellipse with major and minor axes $a$ and $b$ at rate $c$.
\end{solution}
