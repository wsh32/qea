Consider a body moving in 3D with position vector

\begin{align*}
    \boldsymbol{r}(t) = a\cos(ct) \hat{\boldsymbol{i}} + a \sin(ct) \hat{\boldsymbol{j}} + bct \hat{\boldsymbol{k}}
\end{align*}

Describe the path that the body should take.

\begin{solution}
    The body is moving in a helix of radius $a$ at rate $c$, rising at rate $b$. 
\end{solution}
