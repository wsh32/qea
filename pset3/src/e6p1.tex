Suppose that you know that you have apples and oranges in the fridge and that in the genetically engineered future, the weights of all apples are 3 oz and all oranges are 4 oz. Because of inflation in this genetically engineered future, the price of each apple is \$1 and the price of each orange is \$2. Suppose that you also know that you paid \$13 total for your fruit and the total weight of the fruit is 33 oz. Let $n_o$ and $n_a$ be the numbers of oranges and apples in your fridge respectively, and that you donâ€™t know what these numbers are.

\begin{align*}
    \boldsymbol{n} = \begin{bmatrix}
        n_o \\ n_a
    \end{bmatrix} \\
    \boldsymbol{d} = \begin{bmatrix}
        13 \\ 33
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

Write an equation relating $\boldsymbol{n}$ and $\boldsymbol{d}$, using a matrix-vector product.

\begin{solution}
    \begin{align*}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            2 & 1 \\
        4 & 3
        \end{bmatrix}\boldsymbol{n} = \boldsymbol{d}
    \end{align*}
\end{solution}
