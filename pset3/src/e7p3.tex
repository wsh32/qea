Recall the example with fruits from class: Suppose that you have a total number of 14 apples, oranges and pears in your fridge. Suppose that each apple costs \$1, each orange costs \$2 and each pear costs \$3. Assume also that the weights of every apple is 3 oz, every orange is 4 oz
and every pear is 3 oz. Additionally, suppose that the total weight of the fruits is 45 oz, and you paid a total of \$21 for the fruit.
