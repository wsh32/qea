For which vectors $\boldsymbol{b}$ does $\boldsymbol{Ax} = \boldsymbol{b}$ have a solution? Why are there only certain $\boldsymbol{b}$ vectors that lead to solutions to $\boldsymbol{Ax} = \boldsymbol{b}$?

\begin{solution}
    $\boldsymbol{b}$ has a solution where it is on the line $y=-0.5x$. This is because the basis vectors are linearly dependant.
\end{solution}
