Based on your FBD of the circular segment on an inclined ramp, what condition must the horizontal positions of the CG and contact point satisfy for the “ducky” to be in static equilibrium (assuming no slip)?

\begin{solution}
    To put the ducky in static equilibrium, the CG and contact point must be aligned in the $\hat{j}$ direction.
