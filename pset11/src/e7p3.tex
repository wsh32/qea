What can be done to increase the slip-angle for the ducky? What are the tradeoffs for the modifications?

\begin{solution}
    To increase the slip angle for the ducky, the coefficient of friction between the ducky and the ramp must be increased. This most likely means changing the material of the ducky or the ramp.
