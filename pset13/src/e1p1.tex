Imagine a NEATO moving along a circle given by:

\begin{align*}
    \boldsymbol{r}(t) = R\cos(\alpha t) \hat{\boldsymbol{i}} + R\sin(\alpha t) \hat{\boldsymbol{j}}
\end{align*}

How does the sign of $\alpha$ affect the path that the Neato takes around the circle?

\begin{solution}
    The sign of $\alpha$ determines the direction that the Neato takes. If positive, it will travel counterclockwise. If negative, it will travel clockwise.
\end{solution}
