For the uniform circular motion we have been investigating so far, what does the parameter we have labeled $\alpha$ represent? How is it related to the time it takes to complete one traverse of the circular trajectory?

\begin{solution}
    $\alpha$ represents the angular frequency of motion.
\end{solution}
