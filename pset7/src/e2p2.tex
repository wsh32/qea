What would have happened if you had created $\boldsymbol{B}$ using only information about the values along $p_1$ instead of $p_2$?

\begin{solution}
    Because the direction of $p_2$ is where the most variance lies, the projection onto $p_1$ would have less resolution than the projection onto $p_2$.
\end{solution}
