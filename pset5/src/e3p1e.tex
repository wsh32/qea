If you create a data matrix that has completely uncorrelated datasets, what should the correlation matrix look like?

\begin{solution}
    If the datasets were completely uncorrelated, the correlation matrix would be:
    
    \begin{align}
        \boldsymbol{C} = \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 0 \\
            0 & 1
        \end{bmatrix}
    \end{align}
\end{solution}
