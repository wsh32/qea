If you create a data matrix that has completely identical columns of data, what should the correlation matrix look like?

\begin{solution}
    The correlation matrix would be:
    \begin{align*}
        \boldsymbol{C} = \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 1 \\
            1 & 1
        \end{bmatrix}
    \end{align*}
\end{solution}
