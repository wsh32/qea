What is the expression for the correlation matrix between different pixels? What is the size of this correlation matrix?

\begin{solution}
    To find the correlation matrix, we would take the transpose of the data matrix. This can be found in matlab with: \
    
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Matlab]
C = corrcoef(data')
    \end{lstlisting}
    
    The size of the correlation matrix is $mn \times mn$.
\end{solution}
