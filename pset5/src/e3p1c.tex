What are the elements of the off-diagonal? What is element $C_{12}$ of this matrix? What is element $C_{21}$? What do you notice? Is this always going to be true?

\begin{solution} \
$C_{12}$ is the correlation coefficient of $A_1$ and $A_2$. Because $C_{21}$ is the correlation coefficient of $A_2$ and $A_1$, $C_{12} = C_{21}$.
\end{solution}
