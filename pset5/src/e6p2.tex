Now find the correlation between pixels across images. Try taking a single column of this matrix and reshape that column into an image. What does that image tell you?

\begin{solution} \
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Matlab]
im_corr = corrcoef(transpose(rdfaces));
im_corr_adj = reshape(im_corr(:,1), 25, 25);
imagesc(im_corr_adj)
    \end{lstlisting}
    
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{img/e6p2.png}
    \end{center}
\end{solution}
