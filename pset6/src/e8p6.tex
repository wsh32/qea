Explain what you see in terms of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

\begin{solution}
    The translation $\boldsymbol{Ax}$ where $\boldsymbol{x}$ is an eigenvector of $\boldsymbol{A}$ is an eigenvector of $\boldsymbol{A}$, and therefore, will always be in the same direction, no matter how many transformations $\boldsymbol{A}$ are applied.
\end{solution}
