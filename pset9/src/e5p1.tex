Consider the cantilevered beam with constant cross section and mass distribution shown below. The beam has mass $M$, and is supported at one end by a fixed joint. For this exercise, you can assume the beam is stationary $(\boldsymbol{a}=\boldsymbol{\alpha}=0, \boldsymbol{v}=\boldsymbol{\dot{\theta}}=0)$

When drawing a free body diagram for the cantilevered beam, which body should you isolate?

\begin{solution}
    I would isolate the beam.
