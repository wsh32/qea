The picture below shows a person trying to tighten a nut with a wrench. The point of view is that of standing, facing the end of the bolt as shown and turning clockwise. Draw a free body diagram for
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The wrench only
    \item The nut only
\end{enumerate}

Then, using your FBDs, explain how the wrench is used to tighten the nut.
