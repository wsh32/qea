Consider the pinned beam with constant cross section and mass distribution shown below. The beam is supported at one end by a pinned joint. For this exercise, you can assume the beam is stationary $(\boldsymbol{a}=\boldsymbol{\alpha}=0, \boldsymbol{v}=\boldsymbol{\dot{\theta}}=0)$

When drawing a free body diagram for the pinned beam, which body should you isolate?

\begin{solution}
    I would isolate the beam.
