Typically, for a 2D problem, we would split the force equation into two equations, $\sum F_{\hat{i}}$ and $\sum F_{\hat{j}}$. Can we do that here? What about the forces that are defined in the $\left[\hat{x}, \hat{y} \right]$ frame? Can forces in different frames be added?

\begin{solution}
    Yes, we can split these equations into two separate equations, but then not all reference frames would be represented. Forces in different reference frames do not add.
\end{solution}
