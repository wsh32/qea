For a two-dimensional (x,y) system, how many equations are needed to prove static equilibrium? Please write them. How about for a three-dimensional (x,y,z) system?

\begin{solution}
    For a two-dimensional system, three equations are needed to prove static equilibrium.
    
    \begin{align*}
        \sum F_x &= 0 \\
        \sum F_y &= 0 \\
        \sum \tau_z &= 0 \\
    \end{align*}
    
    For a three-dimensional system, six equations are needed to prove static equilibrium.
    
    \begin{align*}
        \sum F_x &= 0 \\
        \sum F_y &= 0 \\
        \sum F_z &= 0 \\
        \sum \tau_x &= 0 \\
        \sum \tau_y &= 0 \\
        \sum \tau_z &= 0 \\
    \end{align*}
\end{solution}
