Now consider that we drop this object onto the surface. During the time that the object is decelerating to a stop when it comes into contact with the surface is the normal force exerted by the surface on the object greater than, less than, or equal to the force from part 3?

\begin{solution}
    Greater than. The force from part 3 gives the force when the object is at rest, but during this time, the object is also experiencing a force from the deceleration.
\end{solution}
