"I am pushing a coffee cup across my desk. Since it is in motion, I know that the magnitude of the frictional force acting on the cup is given by $\mu_kN$, where $\mu_k$ is the coefficient of kinetic friction and $N$ is the normal force the table exerts on the cup.‚Äù True or false?

\begin{solution}
    True
\end{solution}
