“I am pushing on a coffee cup that is sitting on my desk. Since it is not moving, I know that the magnitude of the frictional force acting on the cup is given by $\mu_sN$, where $\mu_s$ is the coefficient of static friction and $N$ is the normal force the table exerts on the cup.” True or false? Why?

\begin{solution}
    False. Because the cup is not moving, the frictional force is less than $\mu_sN$.
\end{solution}
