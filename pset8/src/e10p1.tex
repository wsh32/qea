A logarithmic spiral can be defined by the parametric equations

\begin{align*}
    x = ae^{-bu} \cos{(u)}, y = ae^{-bu} \sin{(u)}, a > 0, b > 0, u \in [0, \infty)
\end{align*}

How does $a$ and $b$ change the curve?

\begin{solution}
    If $b=0$, this is a circle with radius $a$. If not, it is a spiral that starts at $\left(a, 0\right)$ and approaches 0. The rate that it spirals increases as $b \to 0$
\end{solution}
