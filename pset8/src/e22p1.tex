$\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$ are two arbitrary, non-parallel vectors in three-dimensional space. Using them, construct the following vectors.

The vector $\hat{A}$, which has length of 1, and points in the direction of $\overrightarrow{A}$.

\begin{solution}
    $\hat{A} = \overrightarrow{A} / \left|\overrightarrow{A}\right|$
\end{solution}
