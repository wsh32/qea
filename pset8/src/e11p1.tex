A helix in 3D can be defined by the parametric equations

\begin{align*}
    x = a \cos{(u)}, y = a \sin{(u)}, z = bu, a > 0, b > 0, u > 0
\end{align*}

How do $a$ and $b$ change the curve?

\begin{solution}
    $b$ controls the pitch of the helix, and $a$ controls the radius of the circle.
\end{solution}
