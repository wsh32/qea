What does the dot product of two vectors tell you about the two vectors? What about the cross product?

\begin{solution}
    The dot product measures how parallel two vectors are, and the cross product measures how perpendicular the two vectors are, and is in the direction orthogonal to the plane the two vectors define.
\end{solution}
