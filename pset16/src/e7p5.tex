Assuming you place your NEATO at $(1, -1)$ pointing along the $y$-axis, how much do you have to rotate it in order to align it with the gradient at $r_0$? What would be a reasonable angular speed?

\begin{solution}
\begin{align*}
    \theta &= \arctan(\nabla f(1, -1)) = 1.37 \mathrm{rad}
\end{align*}
\end{solution}
