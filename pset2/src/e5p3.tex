Suppose you know that you have apples and oranges in the fridge and the weights of all apples are 3 oz and all oranges are 4 oz. The price of each apple is \$1 and the price of each orange is \$2. Suppose you know you paid \$13 total for your fruit and the total weight of the fruit is 33 oz. 

\begin{align*}
    \boldsymbol{n} = \begin{bmatrix}
        n_o \\ n_a
    \end{bmatrix} \\
    \boldsymbol{d} = \begin{bmatrix}
        13 \\ 33
    \end{bmatrix}
