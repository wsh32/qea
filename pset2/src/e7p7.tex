Predict what would happen if you operate on the original rectangle with $\boldsymbol{SR}$, where $\boldsymbol{R}$ is the rotation matrix. How about $\boldsymbol{RS}$?

\begin{solution}
    Multiplying by $\boldsymbol{SR}$ would rotate the rectangle, then stretch it unevenly in the $x$ and $y$ directions. This results in a parallelogram. Multiplying by $\boldsymbol{RS}$ stretches the rectangle, then rotates it. This results in a rotated rectangle.
\end{solution}
